Artist Sol Lewitt (1928-2007) is well-known for creating algorithmic drawings that exist as sets of instructions,
rather than as a finalized, rendered piece.

On a black wall, a white trapezoid within which are white vertical parallel lines and a white square within 
which are white horizontal parallel lines. The vertical lines within the trapezoid do not enter the square, 
and the horizontal lines within the square do not enter the trapezoid.
